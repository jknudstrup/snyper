(Prompt for Claude to help spec out the screens plan)

Each screen should have a title text and, other than the main screen, a "Back" button that takes the UI up on level. Some of the screens will have links to other screens: these will be labeled buttons that change the active screen to the linked screen.

Screens:

- Main:

* Title text
* Links:
  -- New Game
  -- Options
  -- Debug
