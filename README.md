# SNYPER - Carnival Target Shooting Game

**SNYPER** is a carnival-style target shooting game built for Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontrollers with a revolutionary GUI-first architecture.

## Architecture Overview

The system consists of networked Raspberry Pi Pico W devices:

- **Master Device**: Runs the game controller with ST7789 display, WiFi AP, HTTP server, and game logic
- **Target Devices**: WiFi clients that control individual targets with fast ping responses and target control endpoints

### Key Features

- **GUI-First Architecture**: Built with micropython-micro-gui controlling the main event loop
- **Multi-Screen Interface**: Navigation hub with New Game, Options, and Debug screens
- **Network Management**: WiFi access point with HTTP-based target communication
- **Target Control**: Lightning-fast ping responses and raise/lower target commands
- **Device Identity System**: Single codebase deployed with different device roles

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Configuration

Create `config.conf` with your device serial ports. Here's an example, you can modify it by replacing the ports to match your setup:

```bash
SERIAL_MASTER="/dev/tty.usbmodem11301"
SERIAL_TARGET="/dev/tty.usbmodem11401"
```

**Finding Device Ports:**

- Connect your Pico W devices via USB
- Run `ls /dev/tty.usbmodem*` to find available ports
- Update `config.conf` with the correct port paths

### 2. Development Mode (Live Coding)

Run code directly from your development machine:

```bash
# Run master device (default)
./dev.sh
or
./dev.sh master

# Run target devices
./dev.sh target_1
./dev.sh target_2

# Test disable mode. This ensures that the device, when rebooting,
# doesn't execute its startup code. Useful for dev testing
./dev.sh disable
```

### 3. Production Deployment

The sync script is invoked as follows:
`sh .sync.sh <device_name>`

Deploy code to device storage for standalone operation:

```bash
# Deploy to master device (default)
./sync.sh
./sync.sh master

# Deploy to target devices (the argument will set the target name)
./sync.sh target_1
./sync.sh target_2

# Disable device (prevent auto-start. Note: not super functional at the moment)
./sync.sh disable
```

## Device Identity System

Both scripts use the same device identity switching mechanism:

1. **Device Identity Generation**: Creates `src/device_id.json` with specified node_id
2. **Automatic Configuration**: Device reads identity and configures role accordingly
3. **Single Codebase**: Same code deployed with different device roles

**Development vs Production:**

- **dev.sh**: Mounts code from host filesystem, runs via `mpremote mount`
- **sync.sh**: Copies code to device storage, runs standalone after deployment

## Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ master.py              # Main entry point for master device
â”œâ”€â”€ target.py              # Main entry point for target device
â”œâ”€â”€ master_controller.py   # Controller core with SystemState/GameState
â”œâ”€â”€ master_server.py       # HTTP server using controller
â”œâ”€â”€ target_server.py       # Target endpoints with ping/control
â”œâ”€â”€ helpers.py             # Shared utilities and network reset
â”œâ”€â”€ views/                 # Screen modules (MainScreen, DebugScreen, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ device_id.json         # Generated device identity (created by scripts)
â””â”€â”€ config.json            # Base device configuration
```

## Development Commands

The `dev.sh` script will, by default, mount the contents of the 'src' directory and run them on the given device without transferring any files.

If you run it with the `-o` flag, it will run its onboard code in either master or target mode (by running master.py or target.py), depending on the name given. This is meant to test a recently-synced build to check for subtle differences between mounted execution and onboard execution.

```bash
./dev.sh                   # Run master (development mode)
./dev.sh target_1          # Run target (development mode)
./dev.sh target_1 -o       # Run target.py after sync (development mode)

./sync.sh master           # Deploy to master device
./sync.sh target_1         # Deploy to target device
./sync.sh target_1         # Deploy to target device

./killmp.sh                # Kill stuck mpremote processes
```

### 4. Custom Firmware Building

Build optimized MicroPython firmware with frozen Python modules for significant RAM savings:

```bash
# Build firmware with frozen GUI library (~32KB RAM savings)
./build_firmware.sh gui

# Build firmware with frozen microdot library
./build_firmware.sh microdot

# Build firmware with multiple modules
./build_firmware.sh gui helpers.py

# Build standard firmware (no custom modules frozen)
./build_firmware.sh
```

**Firmware Build Features:**
- **Dynamic manifest generation** - Creates manifest based on command arguments
- **Smart validation** - Checks that specified files/folders exist in `src/`
- **Automatic timestamping** - Each build gets unique filename with timestamp
- **Convenience symlink** - `snyper_firmware_latest.uf2` always points to newest build

**Build Configuration:**
All paths are configured in `config.conf` (relative to project root):
```bash
MICROPYTHON_DIR=".extra/micropython"
PORT_DIR="$MICROPYTHON_DIR/ports/rp2"
```

**Deployment Process:**
1. Put Pico W in BOOTSEL mode (hold BOOTSEL while powering on)
2. Copy generated `.uf2` file to USB mass storage device
3. Device reboots with custom firmware containing frozen modules

**Benefits of Frozen Modules:**
- **RAM savings** - Modules execute from ROM instead of RAM
- **Faster imports** - Pre-compiled bytecode loads instantly  
- **Smaller deployment** - Modules embedded directly in firmware

## Hardware Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi Pico W**: WiFi-enabled microcontroller
- **ST7789 240x240 LCD**: 4-bit color mode for optimal RAM usage
- **Physical Buttons**: GPIO-connected controls
- **Target Mechanisms**: Servo or motor-controlled pop-up targets

## Network Architecture

- **Master Device**: Creates WiFi access point and HTTP server
- **Target Devices**: Connect to master's WiFi network
- **Communication**: HTTP requests using microdot library
- **Target Registration**: Automatic discovery and IP tracking
- **Ping System**: Sub-second response times for real-time control

## Development Philosophy

- **GUI-first architecture**: micropython-micro-gui controls the event loop
- **Memory allocation order matters**: Load heavy imports before GUI
- **Network caching elimination**: Always reset interfaces using helpers.py
- **Controller pattern**: Single MasterController manages all system state
- **Incremental progress**: Small changes that work, committed frequently

## Troubleshooting

**Import Path Issues:**

- Development mode uses mounted filesystem
- Device mode uses copied files with different sys.path behavior
- Always test actual device deployment, not just mounted dev mode

**Network Connection Problems:**

- Use `helpers.reset_network_interface()` on startup
- Check `config.conf` has correct serial ports
- Verify devices are properly connected via USB

**Memory Fragmentation:**

- Import server components before GUI initialization
- Use `gc.collect()` when needed
- Follow established import order patterns

## Contributing
